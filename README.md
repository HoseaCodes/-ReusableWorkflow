## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Quickly integrate these actions into your GitHub workflows.
- **Modularity**: Use individual actions to suit your specific needs.
- **Customization**: Configure actions to align with your project's requirements.
- **Continuous Testing**: Automate testing and ensure code quality.
- **Deployment Automation**: Easily deploy your applications with predefined workflows.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation and examples for each action.

       steps:
         - name: Checkout repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Deploy Application
           uses: reusable-workflows/deploy-action@v1
           with:
             environment: production
             token: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
   ```

## Usage

To use these actions in your GitHub workflows, follow these steps:

1. Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository if it doesn't already exist.

2. Create a YAML file (e.g., `main.yml`) in the `.github/workflows` directory and define your workflow using the provided actions.

3. Customize the workflow as needed, specifying the relevant triggers, environment variables, and action inputs.

4. Commit and push your workflow file to your repository.
